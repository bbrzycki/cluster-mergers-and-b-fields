# cluster-mergers-and-b-fields
Quantify the impact of magnetic fields on the cores of galaxy cluster mergers by comparing both magnetized and unmagnetized hydrodynamic simulations.

Basic structure of repository:
```
cluster-mergers-and-b-fields/
    py-scripts/
    shell-scripts/
    jupyter-notebooks/
```

After running scripts to generate HDF5 files, slice plots, and movies,
the structure will look something like:
```
cluster-mergers-and-b-fields/
    py-scripts/
    shell-scripts/
    jupyter-notebooks/
    processed-data/
    slice-plots/
    movies/
```

TO DO:

slice plots
* should be able to make movies from these

plot formatting
* much of this will be completed via Jupyter notebooks, since they make it simply easier to finetune
